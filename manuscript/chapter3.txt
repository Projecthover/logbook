#September Update

![103_4582JPG.txt](images/103_4582jpg.txt)

The school year is in full swing, and both Josh and Kayla seem to have adjusted well to their new schools. I, on the other hand, am still getting used to thinking of them as a middle schooler and a high schooler.

As usual, September is keeping us busy with birthdays. Theresa turned a year older today (Wednesday, September 17), friends and family are joining us on Sunday to help us celebrate Kayla’s 14th birthday, and of course I have a birthday next week (September 24). Next week, Kayla will be attending her first homecoming dance.

With all of these changes, it already feels like our lives are in a perpetual state of flux. But, we are also waiting for final news on the house we put a bid on a few weeks ago. If everything works out, sometime in October we should be able to add “move into new house” to our list of todos.
