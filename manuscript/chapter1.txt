Elijah was able to see his very first fireworks display this year from our friend's front yard. Friday evening we visited with our friends Melinda and Nathan, then as it became darker we watched the fireworks which were put on by the Soaring Eagle Casino. Before the fireworks began, Elijah checked out the Little Tykes car that was in their backyard, and played on their slide. He also bounced on a trampoline with Melinda's youngest daughter.
Elijah didn't cry at all during the fireworks display, or when the other people who were there set off firecrackers. Kayla and Josh each got a chance to play with sparklers.
